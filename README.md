# Netwave IP Camera Vulnerability
### Interesting exploit of Netwave IP cameras.

This exploit downloads a file (using `curl`) **`get_params.cgi`** from the device, which contains all the credentials the device is configured with, including personal email addresses, device username & password, ftp credentials, dynamic-dns credentials and lot more.  

**Setup the variables in the script accordingly.**   
--> Setup the Shodan_api key.   
--> You can also modify the search term and the file to download.  


**Disclaimer:** **_Use at your own risk, you are solely responsible for all the activities._**
